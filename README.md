BBN-Q is the Raytheon BBN Technologies quantum group's collection of open source code.  Inside you'll fine instrumentation software, HDL firmware, simulation code and other things we find useful around the lab.

For now, the repo is private but the code on the master branch is already live and public.  Consider yourself warned.  Please work on separate branchces and merge when you want things to go live on https://bbn-q.github.io
